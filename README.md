# WP-SSO
WordPress SSO /User Integration/

Requirements:
- PHP 7.4
- WordPress in your localhost [FTP]
- IPB/IPS

Instalation:
- Import "wp_api" to public_html
- add the plugin in IPB/IPS
- add script in wordpress configuration for cookies.

<center>
/**Enable Cookies*/
define('COOKIE_DOMAIN', $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] );
</center>

- done!
The script works and does not need a monthly update to continue its work. It allows the integration that connects the two accounts via an API.
